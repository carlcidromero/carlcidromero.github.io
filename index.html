        <h2>A Quick "About Me"</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up in the 90's playing street hockey, riding bikes, and
          drinking out of garden hoses all day. By the early 2000's, I began my
          hacking journey by writing custom scripts for Counter-Strike and HTML
          for my Xanga, MySpace, and chat forum posts. After years in school
          bands and rock bands, I started a journey in audio engineering that
          led to work on lots of projects, including some pretty big ones like
          EA Sports UFC 2 and Cyberpunk 2077. I used this craft as a mental
          model for software engineering concepts, helping me transition into my
          first techie role where I successfully launched a Seattle nonprofit's
          first web application in 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays, I am a frontend lead that cofounded and maintains an
          inner-source UI library along with an internal React application. In
          my spare time, I read about the craft of software engineering and
          various concepts around efficiently delivering value in the field.
        </p>
        <h2>"It's 2025, why does your website look like this?"</h2>
        <p>
          Great question! I'll expand on this later, but the TLDR is that I'm
          focusing on semantic HTML and web accessibility while I write a few
          libraries that can progressively enhance this website without
          compromising either one. There are existing solutions that solve this
          problem, but these libraries/frameworks come and go. Plus, it's much
          more fun and beneficial to write my own!
