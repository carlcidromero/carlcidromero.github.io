        <p>
          As a frontend lead, I co-founded my org’s UI library, reducing dev
          time across dozens of teams while enforcing consistent UX and
          accessibility. I also lead frontend architecture for a greenfield
          React project made of micro frontends — ensuring test-driven,
          declarative, maintainable code from day one.

        <h2 id="approach">My Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Understand the org's needs, priorities, constraints, and goals to
          inform my chosen methods of achieving outcomes. While working in a
          large team, I contribute my opinion based on experience, but I remain
          agnostic to the "how" and focus on the "why".
        </p>
        <p>
          But given complete freedom while developing, here are the heuristics I
          follow:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Zero-dependency first.</strong> Vanilla JS &gt; libraries.
            TypeScript only when complexity calls for it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance-aware.</strong> Small bundles, semantic HTML,
            minimal CSS, almost no JS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Test-first.</strong> One of my greatest accomplishments is
            having driven org-wide adoption of the testing pyramid and
            test-driven development (TDD).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mentorship-focused.</strong> I pair, coach, and translate
            business needs to dev intent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Always user-first.</strong> Simple, accessible, maintainable
            interfaces at every layer.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="tech">Tech I Lean On</h2>
        <p>
          React, Zustand, Context API, Custom Hooks, Git Hooks, Semantic HTML,
          Testing Libraries (Jest, Testing Library), Spring Boot, Module
          Federation.

        <h2 id="background">Before Tech</h2>
        <p>
          I made music — for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>UFC 2</em>. I still
          box. I still mix. I still build minimal systems with maximum impact.
