# Bare Metal Web

Starting my digital garden.

Bare Metal Web is a stupidly simple approach to building websites:

- Semantic HTML
- Zero build step
- Minimal JavaScript
- Progressive enhancement
- Accessibility by default

This site is powered entirely by BMW.

If your frontend needs a framework to render content,
you’re solving the wrong problem.

## Principles

- HTML is the product
- JavaScript is optional
- CSS does the heavy lifting
- Complexity must justify itself

## Status

Actively developed. Opinionated by design.
