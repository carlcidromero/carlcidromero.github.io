        <h1>Ship Happens: Why Delivery Derails Your Estimates</h1>
        <p>
          Too often, “software development” is treated as synonymous with
          “software delivery.” But development is only one half of the picture.
        </p>

        <p>
          When estimations are scoped only to coding tasks, the other half —
          delivery — is overlooked. Delivery means deployments, merges across a
          branching strategy, integration testing, UAT, stakeholder sign-off…
          all the steps that make working code truly usable.
        </p>

        <p>
          When these are ignored, estimations look inaccurate. Deadlines are
          missed. Teams burn out. Trust erodes. Businesses feel the impact.

        <h2>Shared Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
          The responsibility of realistic planning must be shared by two
          parties:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Technical leads, who need to surface delivery complexity during
            estimation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Product owners, who need to trust that visibility and plan
            accordingly.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          No organization is perfect, and delivery pipelines always have
          friction points. But ignoring them compounds the problem. Recognizing
          delivery as half the work is the simplest and most effective step
          toward sustainable velocity and healthier teams.
